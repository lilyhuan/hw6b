I lost points for not submitting a pages link for HW5 rather than HW6A. Since we are given the opportunity to get points back for 6A, would it be possible to also get points back for HW5?

Here are the links:

https://lilyhuan.github.io/hw5/
https://github.com/lilyhuan/hw5

If you look at the commit history, I haven't changed anything in HW5 outside of moving folders and editing it slightly when I used it to start HW6.
When I submitted HW5, it was a published website, but I didn't submit the website link because I thought only the repo link was needed. 
It might've looked like the website wasn't published because I put all the files in a folder (so the url would've been /homework5/index.html), but I deleted the folders. I promise the website was published!

Thank you!
